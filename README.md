# Switch Box Routing - Sam Payne - AMSE MSc (Bristol) ##

## Overview ##
This work was completed for an MSc project, to develop a routing solution for a new type of grid FPGA switch box. In src/ is a switch box development 
and simulation environment, written for the testing and comparison of switch box routing algorithms. In src/c++/ is a c++ implementation of two of the algorithms
selected, plus a python wrapper, ready to be integrated into a wider FPGA routing tool.
